01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

There were 4 main areas of improvement:

1.Fix html semantics.
2.Add alt texts to images for screen reader accesibility.
3.Organize and clean the css file to be shorter and clearer.
4.Overall style fixes for better display.

The style was changed in parallel to the html tags to avoid errors. Then, display properties were added and adjusted to fullfil the requirements. After that, alt texts were added. Finally, the code was double-checked to look for missing symbols and errors until the final product was done.
